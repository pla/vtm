## Virtual Train Monitor ##

A train and resource monitor for a vanilla train network, inspired by [LTN Manager](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/LtnManager) and [Train Log](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/train-log), it is made for the way I set up my trains in Factorio. It works perfect with [Train Control Signals](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Train_Control_Signals)

Monitor

* Trains current status and historic records
* Loading and unloading stations
* Depot and refuel stations

For the mod to deceide wether a station is provider, requester or depot, you have to config the settings.
To show the current resources at the stations you need to connect the train stop to your station chests
You can configure groups of stations with (Alt+G) 

Currently I'm not working on the mod and there will be no bug fixes for 1.1, but let's see what 2.0 and SA will bring.
