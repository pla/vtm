# How to make the most out of VTM

## Search and filter

The whole search function is based on Train Station names. You need consistent names for each type of station. For example Provider for a station where production happens and Requester for stations that want things delivered. Also for Depot and maybe Refuel stations.

For VTM to recognize the station type you have to adjust the settings accordingly, you can do that while inside your save and see the results immediately. The "Provider" part has to be on the end of the station name.

If you deceide to use a requester chest icon to mark a requster station, then you need to check "P/R search from start" setting.

To distinguish the stations use an icon in Front of the station name.
This Icon will also make it possible to use filters, every Icon that is in a station name can be clicked an the filter will be set accordingly.

## Whats in stock

To be able to see what's in stock, you have to wire the chests to the station. Be careful to send only the itemcounts the station represents, the icon will be cached and if a station goes to zero the group view will show the icon with a zero amount.

If you accidently set a wrong item, just deconstruct the station and undo it with ctrl-z.

## Trains

Trains will be recorded when they first change their state. Everytime the schedule is complete, a new record will be startet and the old data goes to the history tab.

## History

New History records appear when a train starts at its first schedule record. You can swith between compact and detailed view. In detailed view, you can see how long the train waited at a station and if a depot was used.

## Depots

The Depots tab can be used to display all the stations that are not provider or requester staitons. Like Depots, Refuel stations, Unused station or your Shuttle train stations.

## Unused Stations

If you don't like new Stations with random names, there is a setting that gives every new station a unified name, eg. "Unused Station"
